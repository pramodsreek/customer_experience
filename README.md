# Customer Experience
Customer Experience is the perception of the business that drives growth formed by the interaction of the customer with the business. Tweets are an excellent way of understanding a customer's perception. One benefit of tweet is that it is an insight into issues of business. The issue can be product, process or technology and some of these issues may need urgent attention. 
Python has packages that can analyse tweets for sentiment. This code is a learning exercise. 
* The code needs polishing.
